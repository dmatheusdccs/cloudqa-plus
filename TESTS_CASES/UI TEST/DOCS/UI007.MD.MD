# Test Case ID: UI007  
**Test Case Name**: Checkout with Out-of-Stock Product  
**Type**: Functional Test  
**Priority**: High  

## Preconditions:

- User is on the login page of the application (https://www.saucedemo.com/).
- User credentials (username: standard_user, password: secret_sauce) are available.
- The product in question should be available in the inventory, but for this test, its "Add to Cart" button will be disabled to simulate it being out of stock.

## Test Steps:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the login page at https://www.saucedemo.com/.
2. In the username input field, type `standard_user`.
3. In the password input field, type `secret_sauce`.
4. Click on the "Login" button to access the inventory page.
5. Wait for the inventory list to load and be visible on the page.
6. Intercept the response or manipulate the DOM to simulate that a product is out of stock:
    - Disable the "Add to Cart" button of the first product by executing JavaScript code in the browser context.
    - Change the text content of the button to "Out of Stock".
7. Try to add the product to the cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button (which should now be disabled).

## Expected Result:

- The "Add to Cart" button for the product should be disabled and display "Out of Stock".
- The user should not be able to add the product to the cart.

## Actual Result:

- The "Add to Cart" button for the product was successfully disabled and labeled as "Out of Stock", as expected.
- The user could not add the product to the cart due to the disabled button.

## Status: PASS (The feature is working as expected.)

## Comments:

- This test verifies that the system correctly disables the "Add to Cart" functionality for out-of-stock products.
- No interactions are possible with the out-of-stock product, preventing the user from adding it to the cart.
- This test ensures the robustness of the UI in handling unavailable products by simulating the "Out of Stock" scenario and confirming that the UI responds appropriately.
