# Test Case ID: UI008  
**Test Case Name**: Access Inventory Page After Logout  
**Type**: Functional Test  
**Priority**: High  

## Preconditions:

- User is on the login page of the application (https://www.saucedemo.com/).
- User credentials (username: standard_user, password: secret_sauce) are available.
- User is logged in successfully.

## Environment Setup:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10  
- **Browser**: Google Chrome 138.0.7204.169  
- **Test Data**: Username: `standard_user`, Password: `secret_sauce`

## Test Steps:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the login page at https://www.saucedemo.com/.
2. In the username input field, type `standard_user`.
3. In the password input field, type `secret_sauce`.
4. Click on the "Login" button to access the inventory page.
5. Wait for the shopping cart icon to load and be visible on the page (verify successful login).
6. Open the side menu by clicking on the hamburger menu icon (`#react-burger-menu-btn`).
7. Click on the "Logout" link (`#logout_sidebar_link`) to log out of the application.
8. After logging out, try to manually navigate to the inventory page by going to `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html`.
9. Verify that the user is redirected to the login page and the URL is `https://www.saucedemo.com/`.

## Expected Result:

- After logging out, the user should not be able to access the inventory page directly.
- The user should be redirected to the login page (URL: `https://www.saucedemo.com/`).

## Actual Result:

- The user was successfully redirected to the login page, and the URL was `https://www.saucedemo.com/`, as expected.
- The test passed, confirming that the application prevents access to the inventory page after logout.

## Status: PASS

## Comments:

- This test ensures that the application properly handles the logout process and prevents users from accessing protected pages (such as the inventory page) after logging out.
- The test confirms the correct behavior of the page redirection, which is crucial for maintaining security in the application.
- No screenshots were necessary as the test passed successfully.
